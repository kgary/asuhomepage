                                        <p>My general area of research is software engineering; within this field I am currently interested in Agile Methods, Open Source Software, an mobile health (mHealth) applications.</p>
                                        <p>My research methods are use-inspired, meaning I look for new contexts of use for software technologies, and adapt or discover how software engineering principles apply. Therefore my work tends to be multidisciplinary and evolutionary; multidisciplinary in my collaborations, evolutionary in that my approach is to start with specific problems and work towards more general methods.</p>
                                        <p>
                                        I am also engaged in the scholarship of teaching and learning, specifically in the context of software engineering education. A decade ago I created the Software Enterprise as both a hybrid project-based pedagogy for accelerating contextual understanding and industry preparedness of our students, and as an encapsulated set of modules for practical training of software engineering skills for students. The Enterprise now forms the project spine of the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Software Engineering degree at ASU. I am currently examining how Agile approaches can improve the way we teach and learn in an on-demand world.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>I am always looking for and willing to work with, motivated, intellectually curious, and dedicated graduate students!</strong> I currently have 3 funded projects, anticipate funding for 3-4 more, and also support independent study as a way to seed the research process. If you are interested in web/mobile development, agile/open source methods, and domains such as e-learning and mHealth, please make an appointment to come talk with me.

As such I have a long history working with agile methods, open source software, and web (now mobile) software development, in academia and in industry.

How does one scale agile methods? or apply them to safety-critical software? How does an open source community function? How is the rapidly changing nature of web and mobile development impact the organizational structure, development processes, and tools for the software developer?

The system integrates physical devices (an indoor air quality monitor and a digital spirometer), a serious game on a tablet, data gathering processes on the tablet, and data management and reporting capabilities on a server. The result is a system which encourages children to take proper spirometer readings, and a low-cost platform for adapting behaviors to indoor air quality. </p>

                                                        One example HEAL project was R-NOTES, conducted at Children's National Health System (CNHS), which created a wirelessly-controlled link robot for NOTES procedures. In this procedure, the patient "swallows" a link robot through an endoscopically inserted tube into an insufflated abdomen. The link robot is anchored to the abdominal wall using an externally mounted magnet controlled by a 7-DOF Kuka industrial robot arm. Once anchored, the robot's 3 DOF is manipulated through wireless (ZigBee) commands sent via a controlling application. R-NOTES was developed as part of an Army-funded STTR, Kevin Cleary PI at CNHS. Risto Kojchev completed his M.S. thesis on the R-NOTES project.
